## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project is a **fully responsive, animated landing page** built for **Moonlight Cafe & Arena**, a Coffee & Pizza Corner combined with a Box Cricket & Gaming Arena located in Sadasivpet.  

The website allows users to:
- Book slots through WhatsApp  
- View the location through Google Maps  
- Explore food menu & indoor games  
- Enjoy a nightlife-inspired UI  

This website was created **free of cost** for a friend’s business and helped me gain real-world experience using AI tools, deployment platforms, and web development workflows.

The site is **frontend-only**, focused purely on **UI/UX**, and redirects users externally for:
- WhatsApp booking  
- Google Maps  
- Instagram  

There is **no backend** yet.

## 🤖 AI Tools & Assistance  

This project was heavily powered by **AI-assisted development**, demonstrating how AI can help non-developers build production-ready websites.

### 🌟 AI Tools Used  
- **ChatGPT** — code generation, structure, refinement  
- **Gemini** — design direction & brainstorming  
- **Bolt.new** — rapid prototyping  
- **GitHub Copilot** — indirect assistance  
- **AI favicon & image generation tools**  

### 🧠 Personal Note  
I do not know traditional frontend programming deeply, but I understand the **logic** behind how websites are built.  
AI helped me transform these logical ideas into an actual deployed website.

This project proves:
- AI can accelerate development  
- Non-developers can ship production-quality web apps  
- Strong prompts = strong outcomes
